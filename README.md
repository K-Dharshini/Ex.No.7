# Ex. No.7 – Develop a Prompt-Based Application
## Date: 
## Register No.: 212223230047
## Aim
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT — demonstrating how to create a personal productivity assistant that organizes daily tasks, schedules reminders, suggests wellness tips, and answers general queries, while showcasing the progression from simple to advanced prompt designs.
## AI Tools Required
- ChatGPT (Large Language Model)
- Python / Command-Line Interface (for simulation)
- Optional: Memory or database integration (for adaptive responses)
## Explanation
This experiment demonstrates how prompt-based applications can be built using large language models like ChatGPT. The application, a Personal Productivity Assistant, interacts with users in natural language to manage daily activities, provide reminders, and offer health and wellness advice.
### Prompt
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
## Procedure
1. Define Core Requirements – Identify user needs such as task management, scheduling, wellness tracking, and general assistance.
2. Construct Prompts – Create clear, structured prompts for each feature (task entry, reminders, tips, etc.). Example Prompts: "Add a new task to call mom at 6 PM.", "What’s my schedule for tomorrow?", "Give me a wellness tip for better focus."
3. Simulate Interaction – Use ChatGPT or a Python-based interface to simulate natural conversation. Example Dialogue:  
User: Remind me to submit my report by 8 PM.  
Assistant: Got it! I’ll remind you to submit your report by 8 PM.  
4. Collect Feedback – Observe user interactions and improve prompt clarity or response tone. Adjust the assistant’s personality or logic based on user preferences.  
5. Integrate Basic Memory (Optional) – Store user preferences like task categories, wake-up time, or wellness goals. Adapt future responses (e.g., "You usually prefer evening reminders. Shall I set this one for 7 PM?")
## Example
### Personal Productivity Assistant Features
1. Daily Task Manager – Accepts tasks in natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM"), organizes tasks by priority and due date, and provides daily summaries.  
2. Smart Scheduler – Schedules events contextually, sets reminders, and suggests free time slots.  
3. Wellness Tips Generator – Suggests personalized health tips (hydration, posture, screen breaks) and adapts to user feedback.  
4. General Query Assistant – Answers general questions related to study, work, or health with a friendly tone.
### Expected Output
👋 **Hi Dharshini! Here’s your productivity summary for today:**  
🗓 **Tasks:**  
- Finish assignment report (Due by 8 PM)  
- Call mom (6 PM)  
- Pack bag for college tomorrow  
💡 **Wellness Tip:** Stay hydrated! Try to drink at least 2 liters of water today.  
✨ **Suggestion:** You have 45 minutes free from 4–4:45 PM. Would you like to schedule a short walk or a relaxation break?  
**Console Simulation:**  
Welcome to your Personal Productivity Assistant!  
You: Remind me to submit my report at 8 PM  
Assistant: ✅ Reminder set successfully!  
You: Give me a wellness tip  
Assistant: 💡 Wellness Tip: Take a 5-minute break every hour to stretch and rest your eyes.  
You: exit  
Assistant: Goodbye! Have a productive day 😊

## Result
The experiment successfully demonstrated how to design a prompt-based personal assistant using ChatGPT. Students were able to:  
– Understand how to structure and tailor prompts for real-life utility.  
– Explore creativity by designing features suited to personal or academic needs.  
– Learn fundamental prompt engineering techniques for effective LLM interaction.  
– Realize the practical applications of AI in improving productivity.
## Conclusion
A functional prototype of a Personal Productivity Assistant was conceptualized using prompt engineering with ChatGPT. The activity enhanced understanding of natural language interfaces, adaptability of AI systems, and their potential to support human productivity in daily life.
